### Metric Learning 
Given a set of items, such as words, images, or products, with associated feature vectors, one often wishes to learn a metric between them. These techniques originated in the psychology literature and are in wide use today. A common form of query is the triplet: “is A more similar to B or to C?” and which are preferable for minimizing noise in human studies. 
Metrics can be useful for preprocessing, feature selection, or embedding the items for downstream methods. Despite the history and variety of algorithms, however, there has been little theoretical analysis. In particular, basic questions such as identifiability and sample complexity were unanswered, and the effect of noisy data had not been addressed. In our work, we provide the first identifiability results and first practical sample complexity results for triplet metric learning. Our work has been applied to study perceptual learning in undergraduate chemistry education at UW--Madison. <br/>

### Nearest Neighbors With Noisy Samples
In many real-world settings, practitioners care primarily about most similar/closest items. For instance, in the case of music recommendation, providers only wish to be able to recommend similar songs to a liked song. We develop an active method, based on multi-armed bandit techniques, for learning nearest neighbor graphs to capture similarity information, while being learnable in fewer samples than a metric. We are also developing bandit techniques to answer nearest neighbor queries with access to noisy distance comparisons, inspired by the classic problem in computer science. This has strong ties to adaptive multiple testing and the “good arm identification” literatures.

### Perceptual Learning for Chemistry Education
To succeed in science education, students need to learn to use visual representations such as figures or models. Students must be able to easily extract concepts from representations and translate between different ones. Assessing how well students understand visuals, a key component for personalized tutoring systems, is challenging due to scalability issues and presence of confounding variables. We developed new techniques for metric learning to detect what features of molecules students pay attention to when looking at images in textbooks and are using this to develop a tutoring system for undergraduate chemistry education at UW--Madison.

### Fertility and Miscarriage 
The growth of mobile apps for family planning and pregnancy tracking is an incredible opportunity to study factors affecting fertility and miscarriage on a global scale. In collaboration with sociologists at UW--Madison, we are using supervised learning methods to handle missing data and help answer questions such as how education, addiction, and other factors affect a woman’s ability to conceive, in ways that were not previously possible.
